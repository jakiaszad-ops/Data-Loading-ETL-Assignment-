**1. Data Understanding-
Identify all data quality issues present in the dataset that can cause problems during data loading.**
- | Order_ID | Customer_ID | Sales_Amount   | Order_Date |
| -------- | ----------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| O101     | C001        | 4500           | 12-01-2024 |
| O102     | C002        | Null           | 15-01-2024 |
| O103     | C003        | 3200           | 2024/01/18 |
| O101     | C001        | 4500           | 12-01-2024 |
| O104     | C004        | Three Thousand | 20-01-2024 |
| O105     | C005        | 5100           | 25-01-2024 |
   
  **Data Quality Issues:**

  - Duplicate Primary Key (O101 repeated)

  - Missing value in Sales_Amount (Null)

  - Invalid data type in Sales_Amount ("Three Thousand")

  - Multiple date formats (DD-MM-YYYY and YYYY/MM/DD)

  - Duplicate full record (O101 appears twice)

**2. Primary Key Validation -**
**Assume Order_ID is the Primary Key.**

**a) Is the dataset violating the Primary Key rule?**

**b) Which record(s) cause this violation?**
- a) yes
- b) Order_ID O101 appears twice.

  This breaks uniqueness rule.

**3. Missing Value Analysis -
Which column(s) contain missing values?**

**a) List the affected records**

**b) Explain why loading these records without handling missing values is risky**
- **a) Affected Record:**

  - O102 (Sales_Amount = Null)

- **b) Why risky?**

  - Total sales calculation will be incorrect

  - May cause load failure if column is NOT NULL

  - BI dashboards may treat it as 0 or ignore it  

**4. Data Type Validation -
Identify records where Sales_Amount violates expected data type rules.**

**a) Which record(s) will fail numeric validation?**

**b) What would happen if this dataset is loaded into a SQL table with Sales_Amount as DECIMAL?**
- **a) Which record fails numeric validation?**

  - O104 → "Three Thousand"

  **b) What happens if loaded as DECIMAL?**

  - SQL will throw conversion error

  - Load may fail

  - That row may be rejected

**5. Date Format Consistency -
The Order_Date column has multiple formats.**

**a) List all date formats present in the dataset**

**b) Why is this a problem during data loading?**
- **a) Date formats present:**

  - 12-01-2024 (DD-MM-YYYY)

  - 2024/01/18 (YYYY/MM/DD)

  **b) Why is this a problem?**

  - Database expects one standard format

  - Wrong parsing can change month/day

  - May cause load failure

**6. Load Readiness Decision -
Based on the dataset condition:**

**a) Should this dataset be loaded directly into the database? (Yes/No)**

**b) Justify your answer with at least three reasons**
- **a) Should it be loaded directly?**

  - No.

  **b) Reasons:**

  - Duplicate primary key

  - Invalid numeric value

  - Missing sales amount

  - Inconsistent date formats

  - Dataset must be cleaned first.

**7. Pre-Load Validation Checklist -
List the exact pre-load validation checks you would perform on this dataset before loading.**
- Before loading:

  1. Check Primary Key uniqueness

  2. Check NULL values in mandatory columns

  3. Validate numeric fields (Sales_Amount)

  4. Validate date format consistency

  5. Remove duplicate rows

  6. Trim spaces

  7. Check column data types match schema

**8. Cleaning Strategy -
Describe the step-by-step cleaning actions required to make this dataset load-ready.**
- 1. Remove duplicate Order_ID (keep latest or first record)

  2. Replace Null Sales_Amount

  - Either remove record

  - Or fill using business rule

  3. Convert "Three Thousand" → 3000

  4. Standardize date format to YYYY-MM-DD

  5. Validate data types again

  6. Final QA check

  7. Load into staging table

  8. Then move to final table

**9. Loading Strategy Selection -
Assume this dataset represents daily sales data.**

**a) Should a Full Load or Incremental Load be used?**

**b) Justify your choice.**
- **a) Full Load or Incremental?**

  - Incremental Load.

  **b) Why?**

  - Data represents daily sales

  - Only new records need to be added

  - Faster and efficient

  - Reduces duplication risk

**10. BI Impact Scenario -
Assume this dataset was loaded without cleaning and connected to a BI dashboard.**

**a) What incorrect results might appear in Total Sales KPI?**

**b) Which records specifically would cause misleading insights?**

**c) Why would BI tools not detect these issues automatically?**
- If loaded without cleaning:

  **a) Incorrect Total Sales KPI**

  Problems:

  - Null value ignored

  - "Three Thousand" excluded

  - Duplicate O101 counted twice

  Total sales would be wrong.

  **b) Misleading records:**

  1. O101 (duplicate → double counting)

  2. O102 (Null sales)

  3. O104 (invalid numeric)

  **c) Why BI tools won’t detect automatically?**

  - BI tools assume database is clean

  - They calculate based on stored data

  - They don’t validate business rules automatically
